<!--For the final project you will continue off the foundation that you built in 
your midterm project. You will choose one aspect of the site to refactor - meaning
that you will clean up, or re-approach something that you built differently. This 
change needs to be significant enough to be graded. You will then add JavaScript to your code to introduce some interactions that weren't there before. Look closely at the rubric for what you will be graded for.

You are not allowed to use any JavaScript libraries, including jQuery. You will be
marked down points if you decide to import any JavaScript that you did not write on
your own.
Your Final Project will be presented the last day of class on Thursday, May 9th.
It is mandatory that you attend and present the last day of class, failure to do so
will lead to a 10% markdown on your final project grade.-->
